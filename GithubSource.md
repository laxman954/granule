# Granule Source Code #

We use Git instead of Subversion for managing the source code, for several reasons.
See project's github pages:

http://github.com/JonathanWalsh/Granule

You can browse the source code there, and even download a zip with the source code!

To check out a copy of the source code for yourself:

git clone git://github.com/JonathanWalsh/Granule.git
